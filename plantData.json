When all risk of frost is passed and the soil is warm, harden off and plant aubergines in their final positions. For indoor cultivation, pot on into larger containers or plant 2 aubergines per growbag. Outdoors, plant aubergines in rich fertile soil at a distance of 90cm (3') apart, in rows spaced 90-120cm (3-4') apart. Grow aubergines in a sheltered position in full sun.
